# Libyal copy-n-clean

I'm boring of copying libyal libraries, built with VisualStudio each time new version comes. So what this script does:
- copies x86\x64 builds to user-friendly locations
- removes junk files from definite folders
- removes all VSDEbug\Release folders

### Todos
- compile x86\x64 Release\VSDebug from this script

###Dependencies
- [libyal]  - :package: of cool libs
